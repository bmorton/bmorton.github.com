title: Hello world?
---

This is the obligatory hello world blog post to make sure that everything is working.  As everything does in fact seem to be working, we can get on with the show.

The goal of this blog is to post a little tidbit (almost) daily about something that I learned, most likely in Ruby.  Hopefully the internet police don't come after me if I decide to break either of those rules, either by posting about my Objective-C musings or varying the velocities in which these posts may surface.

Without further ado, welcome (and hello!) to this world, Today in Ruby!
